-- Basic CASE statements

--In this exercise, you will identify matches played between FC Schalke 04 and FC Bayern Munich. 
-- There are 2 teams identified in each match in the hometeam_id and awayteam_id columns, available to you in the filtered matches_germany table. ID can join to the team_api_id column in the teams_germany table, but you cannot perform a join on both at the same time.

-- However, you can perform this operation using a CASE statement once you've identified the team_api_id associated with each team!

SELECT
	-- Select the team long name and team API id
	team_api_id
	,team_long_name
FROM teams_germany
-- Only include FC Schalke 04 and FC Bayern Munich
WHERE team_long_name IN ('FC Schalke 04', 'FC Bayern Munich');

-- Identify the home team as Bayern Munich, Schalke 04, or neither
SELECT 
        CASE 
                WHEN hometeam_id = 10189 THEN 'FC Schalke 04'
                WHEN hometeam_id = 9823 THEN 'FC Bayern Munich'
                ELSE 'Other' 
        END AS home_team,
	COUNT(id) AS total_matches
FROM matches_germany
-- Group by the CASE statement alias
GROUP BY home_team;




-- CASE statements comparing column values

-- In this exercise, you will be creating a list of matches in the 2011/2012 season where Barcelona was the home team. You will do this using a CASE statement that compares the values of two columns to create a new group -- wins, losses, and ties.

SELECT 
	-- Select the date of the match
	date,
	-- Identify home wins, losses, or ties
	CASE 
                WHEN home_goal > away_goal THEN 'Home win!'
                WHEN home_goal < away_goal THEN 'Home loss :(' 
                ELSE 'Tie' 
        END AS outcome
FROM matches_spain;


SELECT 
	m.date,
	--Select the team long name column and call it 'opponent'
	t.team_long_name AS opponent, 
	-- Complete the CASE statement with an alias
	CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'Home win!'
        WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'Home loss :('
        ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
FROM matches_spain AS m
-- Left join teams_spain onto matches_spain
LEFT JOIN teams_spain AS t
ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id;


SELECT 
	m.date,
	t.team_long_name AS opponent,
    -- Complete the CASE statement with an alias
	CASE 
                WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona win!'
                WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona loss :(' 
                ELSE 'Tie' 
        END AS outcome 
FROM matches_spain AS m
LEFT JOIN teams_spain AS t 
ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id
-- Filter for Barcelona as the home team
WHERE m.hometeam_id = 8634; 



-- CASE statements comparing two column values part 2
-- construct a query to determine the outcome of Barcelona's matches where they played as the away team. 

-- Select matches where Barcelona was the away team
SELECT  
	m.date,
	t.team_long_name AS opponent,
	CASE WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona win!'
        WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona loss :(' 
        ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome
FROM matches_spain AS m
-- Join teams_spain to matches_spain
LEFT JOIN teams_spain AS t 
ON m.hometeam_id = t.team_api_id
WHERE m.awayteam_id = 8634;





-- Barcelona and Real Madrid have been rival teams for more than 80 years. Matches between these two teams are given the name El Clásico (The Classic). In this exercise, you will query a list of matches played between these two rivals.

SELECT 
	date,
	-- Identify the home team as Barcelona or Real Madrid
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8634 THEN 'FC Barcelona' 
        ELSE 'Real Madrid CF' END AS home,
    -- Identify the away team as Barcelona or Real Madrid
	CASE WHEN awayteam_id = 8634 THEN 'FC Barcelona' 
        ELSE 'Real Madrid CF' END AS away
FROM matches_spain
WHERE (awayteam_id = 8634 OR hometeam_id = 8634)
      AND (awayteam_id = 8633 OR hometeam_id = 8633);



SELECT 
	date,
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8634 THEN 'FC Barcelona' 
         ELSE 'Real Madrid CF' END as home,
	CASE WHEN awayteam_id = 8634 THEN 'FC Barcelona' 
         ELSE 'Real Madrid CF' END as away,
	-- Identify all possible match outcomes
	CASE WHEN home_goal > away_goal AND hometeam_id = 8634 THEN 'Barcelona win!'
        WHEN home_goal > away_goal AND hometeam_id = 8633 THEN 'Real Madrid win!'
        WHEN home_goal < away_goal AND awayteam_id = 8634 THEN 'Barcelona win!'
        WHEN home_goal < away_goal AND awayteam_id = 8633 THEN 'Real Madrid win!'
