-- Basic CASE statements

--In this exercise, you will identify matches played between FC Schalke 04 and FC Bayern Munich. 
-- There are 2 teams identified in each match in the hometeam_id and awayteam_id columns, available to you in the filtered matches_germany table. ID can join to the team_api_id column in the teams_germany table, but you cannot perform a join on both at the same time.

-- However, you can perform this operation using a CASE statement once you've identified the team_api_id associated with each team!

SELECT
	-- Select the team long name and team API id
	team_api_id
	,team_long_name

	COUNT(id) AS total_matches

-- Group by the CASE statement alias

-- CASE statements comparing column values

-- In this exercise, you will be creating a list of matches in the 2011/2012 season where Barcelona was the home team. You will do this using a CASE statement that compares the values of two columns to create a new group -- wins, losses, and ties.

-- Filtering CASE statement

-- Let's generate a list of matches won by Italy's Bologna team! There are quite a few additional teams in the two tables, so a key part of generating a usable query will be using your CASE statement as a filter in the WHERE clause.

-- Select team_long_name and team_api_id from team
SELECT
	team_long_name,
	team_api_id
FROM teams_italy
-- Filter for team long name

    -- Identify when Bologna won a match
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 9857 AND home_goal > away_goal 
            THEN 'Bologna Win'
		WHEN awayteam_id = 9857 AND away_goal > home_goal

-- CASE with aggregate functions

-- Do the number of soccer matches played in a given European country differ across seasons? We will use the European Soccer Database to answer this question.

-- You will examine the number of matches played in 3 seasons within each country listed in the database. This is much easier to explore with each season's matches in separate columns. Using the country and unfiltered match table, you will count the number of matches played in each country during the 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2014/2015 match seasons.

SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Count games from the 2012/2013 season

-- SUM / CASE WHEN with multiple conditions

-- In R or Python, you have the ability to calculate a SUM of logical values (i.e., TRUE/FALSE) directly. In SQL, you have to convert these values into 1 and 0 before calculating a sum. This can be done using a CASE statement.
-- There's one key difference when using SUM to aggregate logical values compared to using COUNT in the previous exercise --
-- Your goal here is to use the country and match table to determine the total number of matches won by the home team in each country during the 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2014/2015 seasons.

-- SUBQUERY

-- Scalar subqueries
-- Generate a list of matches where the total goals scored (for both teams in total) is more than 3 times the average for games in the matches_2013_2014 table, which includes all games played in the 2013/2014 season.

-- Subquery with a list

-- Your goal in this exercise is to generate a list of teams that never played a game in their home city. Using a subquery, you will generate a list of unique hometeam_ID values from the unfiltered match table to exclude in the team table's team_api_ID column.

-- Subqueries in FROM

-- Your goal in this exercise is to generate a subquery using the match table, and then join that subquery to the country table to calculate information about matches with 10 or more goals in total!

-- Building on Subqueries in FROM
/*In the previous exercise (above), you found that England, Netherlands, Germany and Spain were the only countries that had matches in the database where 10 or more goals were scored overall. Let's find out some more details about those matches -- when they were played, during which seasons, and how many of the goals were home versus away goals.

You'll notice that in this exercise, the table alias is excluded for every column selected in the main query. This is because the main query is extracting data from the subquery, which is treated as a single table.*/

-- ALL the subqueries EVERYWHERE
-- In soccer leagues, games are played at different stages. Winning teams progress from one stage to the next, until they reach the final stage. In each stage, the stakes become higher than the previous one. The match table includes data about the different stages that each match took place in.

-- In this lesson, you will build a final query across 3 exercises that will contain three subqueries -- one in the SELECT clause, one in the FROM clause, and one in the WHERE clause. In the final exercise, your query will extract data examining the average goals scored in each stage of a match. Does the average number of goals scored change as the stakes get higher from one stage to the next?
