-- Basic CASE statements

--In this exercise, you will identify matches played between FC Schalke 04 and FC Bayern Munich. 
-- There are 2 teams identified in each match in the hometeam_id and awayteam_id columns, available to you in the filtered matches_germany table. ID can join to the team_api_id column in the teams_germany table, but you cannot perform a join on both at the same time.

-- However, you can perform this operation using a CASE statement once you've identified the team_api_id associated with each team!

SELECT
	-- Select the team long name and team API id
	team_api_id
	,team_long_name
FROM teams_germany
-- Only include FC Schalke 04 and FC Bayern Munich
WHERE team_long_name IN ('FC Schalke 04', 'FC Bayern Munich');

-- Identify the home team as Bayern Munich, Schalke 04, or neither
SELECT 
        CASE 
                WHEN hometeam_id = 10189 THEN 'FC Schalke 04'
                WHEN hometeam_id = 9823 THEN 'FC Bayern Munich'
                ELSE 'Other' 
        END AS home_team,
	COUNT(id) AS total_matches
FROM matches_germany
-- Group by the CASE statement alias
GROUP BY home_team;




-- CASE statements comparing column values

-- In this exercise, you will be creating a list of matches in the 2011/2012 season where Barcelona was the home team. You will do this using a CASE statement that compares the values of two columns to create a new group -- wins, losses, and ties.

SELECT 
	-- Select the date of the match
	date,
	-- Identify home wins, losses, or ties
	CASE 
                WHEN home_goal > away_goal THEN 'Home win!'
                WHEN home_goal < away_goal THEN 'Home loss :(' 
                ELSE 'Tie' 
        END AS outcome
FROM matches_spain;


SELECT 
	m.date,
	--Select the team long name column and call it 'opponent'
	t.team_long_name AS opponent, 
	-- Complete the CASE statement with an alias
	CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'Home win!'
        WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'Home loss :('
        ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome

                WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona loss :(' 
                ELSE 'Tie' 
        END AS outcome 
FROM matches_spain AS m
LEFT JOIN teams_spain AS t 
ON m.awayteam_id = t.team_api_id
-- Filter for Barcelona as the home team
WHERE m.hometeam_id = 8634; 



-- CASE statements comparing two column values part 2
-- construct a query to determine the outcome of Barcelona's matches where they played as the away team. 

-- Select matches where Barcelona was the away team
SELECT  
	m.date,
	t.team_long_name AS opponent,
	CASE WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona win!'
        WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'Barcelona loss :('

-- Barcelona and Real Madrid have been rival teams for more than 80 years. Matches between these two teams are given the name El ClÃ¡sico (The Classic). In this exercise, you will query a list of matches played between these two rivals.

SELECT 
	date,
	-- Identify the home team as Barcelona or Real Madrid
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8634 THEN 'FC Barcelona' 
        ELSE 'Real Madrid CF' END AS home,
    -- Identify the away team as Barcelona or Real Madrid
	CASE WHEN awayteam_id = 8634 THEN 'FC Barcelona'

WHERE (awayteam_id = 8634 OR hometeam_id = 8634)
      AND (awayteam_id = 8633 OR hometeam_id = 8633);



SELECT

-- Filtering CASE statement

-- Let's generate a list of matches won by Italy's Bologna team! There are quite a few additional teams in the two tables, so a key part of generating a usable query will be using your CASE statement as a filter in the WHERE clause.

-- Select team_long_name and team_api_id from team
SELECT
	team_long_name,
	team_api_id
FROM teams_italy
-- Filter for team long name
WHERE team_long_name = 'Bologna';


-- Select the season and date columns
SELECT 
	season,
	date,
    -- Identify when Bologna won a match
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 9857 AND home_goal > away_goal 
            THEN 'Bologna Win'
		WHEN awayteam_id = 9857 AND away_goal > home_goal 
            THEN 'Bologna Win' 
		END AS outcome
FROM matches_italy;


-- Select the season, date, home_goal, and away_goal columns
SELECT 
	season,
    date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal
FROM matches_italy
WHERE 
-- Exclude games not won by Bologna
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 9857 AND home_goal > away_goal THEN 'Bologna Win'
		WHEN awayteam_id = 9857 AND away_goal > home_goal THEN 'Bologna Win' 
		END IS NOT NULL;





-- CASE with aggregate functions

-- Do the number of soccer matches played in a given European country differ across seasons? We will use the European Soccer Database to answer this question.

-- You will examine the number of matches played in 3 seasons within each country listed in the database. This is much easier to explore with each season's matches in separate columns. Using the country and unfiltered match table, you will count the number of matches played in each country during the 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2014/2015 match seasons.

SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Count games from the 2012/2013 season
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013' 
        	THEN m.id ELSE NULL END) AS matches_2012_2013
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
-- Group by country name alias
GROUP BY country;


SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Count matches in each of the 3 seasons
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013' THEN m.id END) AS matches_2012_2013,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2013/2014' THEN m.id END) AS matches_2013_2014,

FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
-- Group by country name alias
GROUP BY country;




-- SUM / CASE WHEN with multiple conditions

-- In R or Python, you have the ability to calculate a SUM of logical values (i.e., TRUE/FALSE) directly. In SQL, you have to convert these values into 1 and 0 before calculating a sum. This can be done using a CASE statement.
-- There's one key difference when using SUM to aggregate logical values compared to using COUNT in the previous exercise --
-- Your goal here is to use the country and match table to determine the total number of matches won by the home team in each country during the 2012/2013, 2013/2014, and 2014/2015 seasons.

SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Sum the total records in each season where the home team won
	SUM(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013' AND m.home_goal > m.away_goal 
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_2012_2013,
 	SUM(CASE WHEN m.season = '2013/2014' AND m.home_goal > m.away_goal 
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_2013_2014,
	SUM(CASE WHEN m.season = '2014/2015' AND m.home_goal > m.away_goal 
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
-- Group by country name alias
GROUP BY country;


-- CASE and AVG
-- Your task is to examine the number of wins, losses, and ties in each country. The matches table is filtered to include all matches from the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 seasons.

SELECT 
    c.name AS country,
    -- Count the home wins, away wins, and ties in each country
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN m.id 
        END) AS home_wins,

-- SUBQUERY

-- Scalar subqueries
-- Generate a list of matches where the total goals scored (for both teams in total) is more than 3 times the average for games in the matches_2013_2014 table, which includes all games played in the 2013/2014 season.


SELECT 
	-- Select the date, home goals, and away goals scored
    date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal

-- Filter for matches where total goals exceeds 3x the average
WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) > 
       (SELECT 3 * AVG(home_goal + away_goal)
        FROM matches_2013_2014); 



-- Subquery with a list

-- Your goal in this exercise is to generate a list of teams that never played a game in their home city. Using a subquery, you will generate a list of unique hometeam_ID values from the unfiltered match table to exclude in the team table's team_api_ID column.

SELECT 
	-- Select the team long and short names
	team_long_name,
	team_short_name
FROM team 
-- Exclude all values from the subquery
WHERE team_api_id NOT IN
     (SELECT DISTINCT hometeam_id  FROM match);


-- Let's do some further exploration in this database by creating a list of teams that scored 8 or more goals in a home match.
SELECT
	-- Select the team long and short names
	team_long_name,
	team_short_name
FROM team
-- Filter for teams with 8 or more home goals
WHERE team_api_id IN
	  (SELECT hometeam_id 
       FROM match
       WHERE home_goal >= 8);
